      "🔥 Small tweaks, massive speedup! I optimized a pose estimation pipeline and took it from 9 FPS → 47 FPS!\n",
      "\n",
      "I used 🤗 Transformers with RT-DETR as the detector and ViTPose for keypoint detection. Initially, it ran at 117ms per frame (~9 FPS) on my GPU, too slow for real-time applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔍 What is ViTPose, and why do we need a detector?\n",
      "ViTPose is a top-down pose estimation model that works on cropped images of people rather than the full scene. It requires a detector like RT-DETR to first locate individuals before estimating their keypoints.\n",
      "This top-down approach allows for multi-person pose estimation and typically yields higher accuracy. However, it can be computationally expensive when dealing with multiple people, as ViTPose needs to process each crop separately.\n",
      "\n",
      "⚡ Optimizing the Pipeline\n",
      "By applying 4 key optimizations, I achieved 22ms per frame (~47 FPS)! Here’s what made the difference:\n",
      "\n",
      "✅ Lower precision (FP32 → BF16/FP16) for better hardware utilization.\n",
      "✅ Optimizing the model with torch.compile, 🤗 Transformers models are already designed to avoid graph breaks, making them well-suited for compilation.\n",
      "✅ Using the ‘fast’ image processor from 🤗 Transformers (torch-based instead of numpy-based).\n",
      "✅ Rewriting preprocessing with `roi_align` for more efficient crop extraction and resizing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Originally, I just wanted to squeeze out a little more speed, but I didn’t expect to 5x the FPS with just a few tweaks!\n",
